# SuperConnector

A simple controller for Revo SuperConnect (and other DAB radios).

* Manages on/off current station status
* Displays the set Presets
* Handles selecting the presets.

## Still ToDo

~N/A - now discovered - Preference pane to select the IP address of the DAB Radio.~

~N/A - now discoveredPeresist selected IP address?~

~Scan local subnet?~ 

- Added simple SSDP discovery - discovers one radio.
- Need to persist the discovered address to reduce startup time
- improve startup feedback (Splash screen while discovering?)
- fix double preset handling
- And/or persist discovered presets too?
